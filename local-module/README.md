# Build Terraform Local Modules

This project contains code to create resources from Terraform using local modules and modules hosted in registry. Its illustrates how to build local Terraform modules and use in configuration.

It consists of Terraform configuration in its root directory and Terraform modules in the modules folder.
The modules folder consists of the following modules:

- Security Group
- Security Group Rule

The two modules are used in the Terraform configuration to create a security group and rules.
